This project is a Student Management System written in Java, demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
The main goal of the project is to practice working with classes, objects, constructors, methods, arrays of objects, as well as applying encapsulation, composition, and other OOP concepts.
The project includes two main classes:
Student — represents a student with fields: name, ID, major, current GPA, and total earned credits. Methods allow updating GPA, adding credits, and checking if the student is on the honors list.
Course — represents a course with a name, instructor, and an array of students. It allows adding students, calculating the course average GPA, and finding the student with the highest credits.
The main program (Main.java) demonstrates:
- Creating multiple students and modifying their GPA and credits
- Printing student and course details using toString()
- Using an array of students to calculate:
  - The student with the highest GPA
  - Number of honors students
  - Total earned credits
This project helps understand how to structure Java code, work with objects and methods, and process data using arrays.
The result is a working console program that shows all the main functionalities for managing students and courses.
